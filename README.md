# Collaborative Filtering Models on ML-Latest (small) Dataset
This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of collaborative filtering recommender systems, from memory-based collaborative filtering to more advanced machine learning algorithms. It starts by implementing basics collaborative filtering algorithms such as <b>user-based</b> collaborative filering also known as user-to-user collaborative filtering and <b>item-based</b> collaborative filtering (item-to-item collaborative filtering). This repository also goes through dimensionality reduction based recommendation system. It presents models such as **Singular Value Decomposition** (SVD), **Matrix Factorization** (MF), **Non Negative Matrix Factorization** (NMF) and **Explainable Matrix Factorization** (EMF).
